# Hello World Project for Yeoman
Yeoman is a template generator that utilizes NodeJS, it's super useful for getting a project started and handles a lot of the advanced stuff for you so you can just run yo `Generator Name`, provide some input, and get a project started.

You install the yo cli globally via `npm install -g yo` or `yarn global add yo`
Then you make or install a generator (make sure it's package name is generator-`Generator Name` and that it contains the keyword `yeoman-generator`)

Generators are what generate a project and yeoman provides utility functions for copying and filling in templates (that uses EJS syntax) so you can just create a simple template clone it and get started with a project.

That's about all I have to say about Yeoman, if it seems interesting you can go check it out, this was just a project to get me familiar with the software.
